# tree-Intersection

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

Take in 2 binary trees processes them and find the valuse that are duplicated across the two trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

I approched this with taking the trees and traversing them to put them each in a hash table then assesed the hash table to find the repeats.

--Tests--

will include:
working hash
working ll
working tree traversal
test to make sure the funtion take in trees right
make sure the trees are added to the hashmap
make sure the hash map deal with collisions
test that the function looks for duplicates in trees as it is inserting in to the map and removing them.
