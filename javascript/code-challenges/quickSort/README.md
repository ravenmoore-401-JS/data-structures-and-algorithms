# merge sort

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

take the selection sort pseudocode and step through it and write a blog style entry at each step... then implement the code.

## Approach & Efficiency

See attached blog
[blog](./blog.md)

the big o values are as follows for this function

- Time: O(log n^2)
  - this is becasue we are runnin over n length array n number of times n number of times recursively so it sucks for time.

- Space: O(1)
  - this is because we dont return any new arrays or stoarge we make tempoaray storage??.
